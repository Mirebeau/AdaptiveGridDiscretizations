    "In this notebook, we compute the route that minimizes fuel consumption for a simplified boat model, with time-independent data, and without constraint on the arrival time. The instantaneous fuel consumption of the boat, moving a velocity $v$ at a position $x$, is a quadratic function\n",

    "- $\\mu > 0$ is the fuel consumption at rest (or any other time penalty).\n",
    "- $\\omega$ is a drift velocity, due to e.g. water currents.\n",
    "- $M \\succ 0$ is a positive definite matrix describing the geometry around the position $x$ (which typically lies on a sphere, the earth). We denote $<v,w>_M := <v,M w>$ and $\\|v\\|_M := \\sqrt{<v,v>_M}$.\n",

    "Our assumptions are obviously an strong simplification of reality. Some of them may be relaxed, at the price of more complexity in the implementation and in the modeling phase.\n",
    "- *Time dependent data.* The data, e.g. the water currents, may be time dependent, so as to reflect the evolution of the weather conditions. This modification requires an entirely different set of methods, described in these two notebooks : using a [quadratic cost](../Notebooks_NonDiv/BoatRouting_Time.ipynb), and a [generic cost](../Notebooks_NonDiv/BoatRoutingGeneric_Time.ipynb).\n",
    "- *Prescribed arrival time.* The arrival date of the boat may be fixed in advance. This can be handled with a small modification: consider the modified cost $\\tilde c(x,v) = c(x,v) + \\alpha$, where $\\alpha>0$ is a constant penalizing travel-time. Then adjust the constant $\\alpha$, using e.g. dichotomic search, so that the arrival time is the one prescribed.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    c(x,v) = \\sup_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} a_\\lambda(x) + <b_\\lambda(x),v> + \\frac 1 2 \\|v\\|^2_{c_\\lambda(x)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Any cost which is convex and with at least quadratic growth at infinity, can be approximated in this form. However, determining this cost (which depends on the physical properties of the boat), and approximating it (fitting a convex set with an intersection of ellipsoids), may raise difficulties in itself.\n",
    "- *Local controllability.* We do need that $c(x,v)<\\infty$ for all $v$ in a neighborhood of the origin, in other words the boat is able to navigate in any direction, in any weather condition, for a sufficiently high fuel consumption. The time dependent formulation does not suffer from this restriction, see [this notebook](../Notebooks_NonDiv/BoatRouting_Time.ipynb).\n",
    "- *Additional state variables.* The boat state may include variables additional to position. For instance velocity if the boat has inertia, or the current state of the sails if any."
