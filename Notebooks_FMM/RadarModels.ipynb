    "A use case of interest is to minimize the probability of detection by a surveillance device, along a trajectory. For instance an airplane or a drone may attempt to avoid detection by a radar, and this type of model and assumption may in principle be incorporated in the radar design and configuration.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a function of the detector-target relative orientation:\n",
    "* *Blind radial speeds.* Depending on the *pulse frequency*, a radar may not be able to detect objects whose radial speed is the multiple of a given value. If the target is moving at a fixed velocity, then this translates into blind relative angles for the detector.\n",
    "* *Radar equivalent area.* The amount of radar reflected by an object strongly depends on its features and on their relative orientation w.r.t the radar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic radar models feature all of the above complexities simultaneously, as well as numerous other, and various constraints - e.g. a lower bound on the product of the pulse frequency and the pulse repetition interval.\n",

    "**Optimization.**\n",

    "The problem of interest is defined as a two-level optimization, over $\\gamma$ and $\\xi$ successively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Minimum over $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$.* We extract, up to discretization errors, the globally optimal trajectory among all admissible $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, and the corresponding minimal cost. For that purpose, the problem is reformulated in the form of a generalized Eikonal partial differential equation, which is discretized and solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Maximum over $\\xi \\in \\Xi$.* The optimization over $\\xi \\in \\Xi$ is usually non-convex and non-differentiable. The HFM library is able to compute the gradient of the objective w.r.t $\\xi$, which can be used within a generic optimization routine such as gradient ascent or BFGS.
