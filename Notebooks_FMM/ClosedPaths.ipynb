Paths are subject to a penalization of curvature, and the path tangent at the extremal and intermediate endpoints is free. From a mathematical standpoint, these 'points' should thus be regarded as subdomains $\\{p\\} \\times S^1$ within the position-orientation space $R^2 \\times S^1$ where the eikonal equation is solved.\n",

Thus is is not surprising that a different initial configuration leads the optimization procedure to select a distinct local optimum. We illustrate this instable behavior by shifting one of the detectors to the right initially."
