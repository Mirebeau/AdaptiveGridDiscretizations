This is not really a package, but a collection of code samples automatically extracted 
from the illustrative notebooks of the AGD library:
https://github.com/Mirebeau/AdaptiveGridDiscretizations

These code samples use in several notebooks. Yet they are too specific and narrow focused 
to be integrated in the base of AGD library.
