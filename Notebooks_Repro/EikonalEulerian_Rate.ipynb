    "In this notebook, we check the convergence rate of the HFM eikonal solver, when applied to Eulerian discretizations of eikonal equations, with a point source.\n",
    "Three cases are considered: Isotropic, Riemannian, and Tilted Transversely Isotropic (TTI) media.\n",
    "The discussion below is mostly irrelevant for Semi-Lagrangian schemes, which typically enjoy strict causality and are therefore more tolerant to perturbations introduced by the source factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway message.** When computing the distance map from a *point source* in a *smooth medium*, using an *Eulerian scheme* for the eikonal equation solve with the *fast marching method*, one can *empirically* achieve a $O(h^{3/2})$ convergence rate error but not more. Note that all the words in italic are essential:\n",
    "* *Point source.* The distance map w.r.t a point source has a singularity, which is the main source of numerical error. Second order convergence can be achieved if the distance is computed from a smooth set instead of a point, for instance.\n",
    "* *Smooth medium.* If the domain is equipped with a non-smooth metric, or if obstacles are present, which is the case in many applications, then the contributions discussed below are not anymore the dominant sources of error.\n",
    "* *Eulerian scheme.* The alternative approach of semi-Lagrangian schemes allows to achieve second order, and even third order convergence rates in these conditions. A number of semi-Lagrangian schemes are implemented in the HFM library, covering the use cases considered below.\n",
    "* *Fast marching method.* The eulerian schemes implemented in the HFM library, when combined with source factorization, fail the causality property. (Although they are small perturbations of causal schemes.) As a result the FMM cannot solve the scheme exactly, and in principle second order accuracy may be restored if one could exactly solve the numerical scheme exactly. However doing this is non-trivial, even with an iterative method, since the second order schemes also fail the degenerate ellipticity property (stability).\n",
    "* *Empirical convergence rates.* Our convergence rate estimates are based on an informal analysis, and backed by numerical experiments. However, establishing guarantees on the convergence rate require an entirely different set of mathematical tools, and is usually limited to $O(\\sqrt{h})$ (half order convergence rate) which is far below the observed accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semi-Lagrangian vs Eulerian discretizations of the eikonal equation.**\n",
    "In view of the discussions presented in this notebook, it may seem preferable to favor the use of semi-Lagrangian schemes when high accuracy is needed. In practice, replace `Isotropic2` and `Riemann2` models with the `Rander2` model which generalizes them both and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization. Similarly, replace the `TTI2` model with the `Hooke2` model which generalizes it and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization. There are however some reasons to study Eulerian schemes:\n",
    "- They are easier to implement, especially in three dimensions. In particular there is no `Rander3` model in the HFM library, and the `Hooke3` model is limited in terms of the anisotropy it can handle.\n",
    "- They are easier to port on the GPU. In particular, the GPU eikonal solver present in the agd library does not apply to the `Hooke` models (semi-lagrangian). It does handle the `Rander2` and `Rander3` models, but based on a different implementation (eulerian) than the HFM library (semi-lagrangian).\n",

    "**Multigrid techniques.**\n",
    "Another approach to achieve second order accuracy would involve running the fast marching method twice, first on a fine grid in a neighborhood of the seed, then on the full domain. This technique is a bit technical to put in place, and is not considered here."

    "We present an *informal* discussion of the expected accuracy of the fast marching method when solving Eulerian discretizations of Eikonal PDEs.\n",
    "Let us emphasize that, as soon as the data is non-smooth, or some obstacles are present, which is common in a number of applications, the elements discussed below are not anymore the dominant sources of error.\n",
    "Note that establishing rigorous estimates for the convergence rate of the eikonal equation requires a different set of techniques than the informal arguments below, and that the best error estimates usually established are $O(h^{\\frac 1 2})$.)\n",

    "    \\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq I} \\alpha_i \\max\\{0, u(x)-u(x-h e_i), u(x)-u(x+h e_i)\\}^2 = h^2.\n",

    "For isotropic metrics, one has $I=d$ the domain dimension, unit weights $\\alpha_i=1$, and offsets $(e_i)_{i=1}^d$ defined as the canonical basis.\n",
    "For Riemannian metrics, the weights and offsets are built adaptively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above basic numerical scheme (with suitable boundary conditions) yields a coupled system of non-linear equations on the discretization grid $X_h = \\Omega \\cap h Z^d$, where $h>0$ is the grid scale and $\\Omega$ is the PDE domain. It can be solved in a single pass using the fast marching method thanks to the following properties.\n",
    "* *Degenerate ellipticity*: the scheme is a *non-decreasing* function of the finite differences $u(x)-u(y)$, $y \\in X_h\\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n",
    "* *Causality*: the scheme only depends on the *positive part* of the finite differences $u(x)-u(y)$, $y \\in X_h\\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n",

    "**seed radius.**\n",
    "On a small neighborhood of the seed point, and in view of the singularity of the solution, it is often preferable to fix the values rather than try to compute them via a numerical scheme. By default, the HFM library defines this region as a disk, whose radius is referred to as the *seed radius*. We distinguish between the absolute seed radius $r$, and the `seedRadius` parameter of the HFM library which is measured in pixels. They are tied by the relation $r = h\\times $`seedRadius`.\n",

This approach is somewhat more technical to put in place, but if done correctly should allow to achieve second order accuracy at a reasonable cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source factored scheme.**\n",
    "The singularity of the solution at the seed point is the source of substantial numerical error, which can be greatly reduced thanks to a technique known as source factorization. The scheme is replaced with \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq I} \\alpha_i \\max\\{0, u(x)-u(x-h e_i)+\\rho_i^{+h}, u(x)-u(x+h e_i)+\\rho_i^{-h}\\}^2 = h^2.\n",

    "and where $u_*$ is a function that has the same singularity as the solution $u$ at the seed point, and that can be efficiently evaluated numerically.\n",
    "A consistency analysis shows that, if $u_*$ obeys the eikonal equation of interest, then it is the exact solution of the scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above source factored numerical scheme is *degenerate elliptic*, hence can be solved with the iterative methods such as fast-sweeping, AGSI, FIM (cite your preferred variant) or the GPU-based eikonal solved included in the agd library. \n",
    "\n",
    "However the source factored scheme is **not** *causal*, due to the addition of $\\rho_i^\\pm$ to the finite differences, hence it cannot be solved exactly with the fast marching method. More precisely, issues arise when the scheme solution satisfies $u(x) < u(x-he_i)$ but $u(x)-u(x-h e_i) + \\rho_i^{+h} > 0$ (and likewise if $u(x) < u(x+he_i)$ but $u(x)-u(x+h e_i) + \\rho_i^{-h} > 0$). Since the successive solution values solved by the Fast Marching Method (FMM) are in increasing order $u(x_0) \\leq u(x_1) \\leq ...$, the FMM cannot use $u(x-h e_i)$ when solving for $u(x)$, even though the corresponding contribution $u(x)-u(x-h e_i) + \\rho_i^{+h}$ is positive (note that it is upper bounded by $\\rho_i^{+h}$).\n",

    "**Second order scheme.**\n",
    "In order to achieve even greater accuracy, second order finite differences may be introduced in the scheme. They are obtained with the second order correction\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\big(u(x)-u(x-h e_i)\\big) + \\frac 1 2 \\big(u(x)-2 u(x-he_i)+u(x-2 h e_i)\\big),\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to the finite differences modification, the numerical scheme looses the *degenerate ellipticity* property, in other words all stability. As a result it cannot be solved as-is by either the fast marching method or an iterative method. Instead the second order correction is activated or deactivated depending on the local behavior of the solution as it is solved, which is easiest done with the FMM. There is no theoretical guarantee that second order convergence is achieved, but the method is empirically not useless. \n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathrm{error}(h,r) = \\frac{h^2} r + r^3\n",

    "attains its minimum $\\approx h^\\frac 3 2$ for $r = \\sqrt h$, up to constant factors. This falls short of second order accuracy.\n",

    "The Tilted transversely isotropic scheme takes the form \n",

    "$$\n",
    "(with possibly the max replaced with a $\\min$). In this form, the scheme is degenerate elliptic and causal. The previously discussed modifications related to source factorization and second order finite differences are applicable, but the focus of this paragraph is on the dependency w.r.t the parameter $t\\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to implementing the optimization over $t \\in [0,1]$\n",
    "* *Finite sampling.* \n",
    "Introduce $K$ equispaced points in the interval, namely $t_k = k/(K-1)$, $0 \\leq k \\leq K$, and optimize over those. A systematic error is introduced in the solution, which is $O(1/K^2)$ overall under standard assumptions.\n",
    "* *Full optimization.*\n",
    "Note that this may sound like an overcomplicated approach, but is does work in practice.\n",
    "For the model of interest, one can show that the interval $[0,1]$ can be split in finitely many sub-intervals with endpoints $0 = t_0 < t_1 \\cdots < t_N = 1$, where the coefficients $t \\mapsto \\alpha_i^t$ are smooth and the offsets $t \\mapsto e_i^t$ are constant. Furthermore one can show that the scheme numerical expression has *no spurious extrema* in $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$, $0 \\leq i < N$. Thus one can optimize over $t \\in [0,1]$ up to machine precision using e.g. golden search (in the proposed implementation a mixture of golden search and of a Newton method).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two approaches are implemented, and can be selected when calling the HFM library. On the CPU *finite sampling* approach was mostly intended for debugging purposes, and the *full optimization* is the default. On the GPU, concerns about thread divergence led us to implement the *finite sampling* approach only."
