    "In this notebook, we compute the optimal costs an paths for a time-dependent optimal control problem, by numerically solving the corresponding (first order time dependent) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The intended application is to find the optimal route for a boat, whose instantaneous fuel consumption is tabulated and depends on the weather conditions, which are known in advance over the domain. The objective is to minimize the overall fuel consumption over the trajectory, for a window of arrival times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fuel consumption model.**\n",
    "Let $\\Omega$ denote the physical domain, and $\\gamma : [0,T] \\to \\Omega$ a trajectory. The corresponding cost, or fuel consumption in the intended application, is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    C(\\gamma) :=  C_0(\\gamma(0)) + \\int_0^T c(t,\\gamma(t),\\gamma'(t)) dt.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This fuel consumption $C(\\gamma)$ depends on two parameter functions: \n",
    "* The *instantaneous fuel consumption* $c(t,x,v)$ for a vehicle moving at velocity $v$, at position $x\\in \\Omega$, and at the time $t$. In practice, this cost is often of the form $c(t,x,v) = c(m(t,x),v)$, where $m(t,x)$ gathers the geographical and meteorological conditions at $(t,x)$, and $c(m,v)$ is a tabulated cost. \n",
    "* The *initial time penalty* $C_0(x)$, for a vehicle starting from the position $x\\in \\Omega$ at time $t=0$. In applications, one often has $C_0(x_0) = 0$ for some specific position $x_0$, and $C_0(x) = \\infty$ for all $x\\neq x_0$. However, both the theoretical treatment and the numerical implementation face difficulties with infinite and/or discontinuous value functions. Fortunately, one can show that $C_0(x) := K \\|x-x_0\\|$ yields the same value function as the former discontinuous initial condition, for sufficiently large $K$, at suitable times $t$ and positions $x$, and under suitable assumptions. This approach is known as exact penalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to compute the minimial fuel consumption needed to reach a position $x$ at time $t$, defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    C(t,x) := \\min_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_t^x} \\mathcal C(\\gamma),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\Gamma_t^x$ collects all paths $\\gamma : [0,t] \\to \\Omega$ such that $\\gamma(t)=x$.\n",
    "Under mild assumptions, the fuel consumption $C(t,x)$ of the boat, needed to reach a point $x$ at time $t$, is the unique solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE, first order and time-dependent,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\partial_t C(t,x) + \\sup_v \\Big(<\\nabla_x C(t,x),v> - c(t,x,v)\\Big) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote by $C(t,x)$ the above cost function, and by $v = V(t,x)$ the optimal velocity at $(t,x)$. \n",
    "Then, again under mild assumptions, the optimal path $\\gamma : [0,T] \\to \\Omega$ for reaching a point $x$ at time $T$ is the obeys the ordinary differential equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\gamma'(t) = V(t,\\gamma(t)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which must solved in reverse time, from $t=T$ to $t=0$, with terminal condition $\\gamma(T) = x$. This process is known as optimal path backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generic and specialized methods.**\n",
    "The optimal control model described above, and the numerical described and implemented below, are very generic. Almost a textbook example. In particular the implementation does not involve Selling's tensor decomposition, or related lattice basis reduction tools, which play a central role in most of the other notebooks of this repository. If further assumptions are introduced in the model, then the numerical cost can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Consider for instance the following special cases:\n",
    "* *Quadratic cost function.*  Assume that the instantaneous fuel consumption is quadratic, namely $c(t,x,v) = \\mu(t,x) + \\frac 1 2 \\|v-\\omega(t,c)\\|^2_{M(t,x)}$, where $\\mu$ is the consumption at rest, $\\omega$ is a drift, and $M$ is a positive definite matrix encoding for instance the earth geometry. Then the HJB equation can be simplified, eliminating the supremum over $v$, and efficiently discretized as described in [this other notebook](BoatRouting_Time.ipynb). In contrast, where here explicitly compute a supremum over approximately $500$ distinct tabulated velocities $(v_i)_{i=1}^I$, which incurs a significant overhead in terms of time and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Time independent cost function.* Assume that the instantaneous fuel consumption is independent of time, namely $c(t,x,v) = c(x,v)$. Then, under mild assumptions, the minimal cost $C(x) = \\min_{t>0} \\alpha t + C(t,x)$, where $\\alpha>0$ is an arbitrary penalization of traveltime, obeys a time independent HJB equation. Following this approach results in a tremendous reduction in computation time and memory usage, as discussed in [this other notebook](../Notebooks_FMM/BoatRouting.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convexity of the cost function.**\n",
    "Consider a cost function $c(v) = c(t,x,v) : R^d \\to R \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}$, where the state variables $t$ and $x$ have been fixed. Let also $\\tilde c$ denote the lower convex envelope of $c$, defined as the largest convex function which is bounded above by $c$. Then, under mild assumptions, $\\tilde c$ and $c$ yield the same value functions $C$ and $\\tilde C$ for the overall trajectory cost. Indeed, the HJB PDE characterizing $C$ can be written in terms of the Legendre-Fenchel transform\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    c^*(t,x,w) := \\sup_v  <w,v> - c(t,x,v),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which is the same for $c$ and $\\tilde c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An upside of this observation is that costs defined for *finitely many velocities*, for instance tabulated velocities $(v_i)_{i=1}^I$, are handled in a reasonable manner. The PDE solution is the same as for the convex envelope $\\tilde c$, which is a natural piecewise linear interpolant of the values $c(t,x,v_i)$, $1 \\leq i \\leq I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A downside of this observation is that a number of vehicles do involve non-convex costs, for instance sail boats, and they are therefore not appropriately described by this simple optimal control model. More complex models, involving a state $\\Theta$ of the vehicle in addition to time $t$ and position $x$, and transitions between different states with appropriate costs, are needed to properly reflect this behavior. The value function thus depends on an additional variable $C = C(t,x,\\theta)$, and the numerical cost is tightly connected to the number of discretization points $(\\theta_k)_{k=1}^K$ used to discretize $\\Theta$.\n",
    "Examples of additional state variables include:\n",
    "* The orientation $\\theta\\in S^1$ of the vehicle. In practice, numerical implementations often use from $K=60$ to $K=200$ orientations. This approach  is therefore quite costly numerically, but is becomes reasonable on the other hand the time dependency can be eliminated. See the notebooks on [curve penalization](../Notebooks_FMM/Curvature.ipynb) possibly [with a drift](../Notebooks_FMM/DubinsZermelo.ipynb).\n",
    "* Two states, corresponding to the side of the boat sail. Or a few states, in a similar fashion. In that case the time dependent approach can be preserved."

For comparison, the sparse linear operator precomputed and saved here holds three coefficients, and three indices, thus $6$ values, for each point $x$ and each velocity $v$.
