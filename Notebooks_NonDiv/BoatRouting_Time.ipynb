    "In this notebook, we compute the optimal route for a boat under the following assumptions:\n",
    "- The objective is to minimize the fuel consumption, for a prescribed the travel time, or window of travel times.\n",
    "- The boat fuel consumption is locally a quadratic function of its relative velocity, w.r.t. water.\n",
    "- The boat total velocity is the sum of the relative velocity w.r.t water and of a drift due to water currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion of the assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions chosen above lead to a specific numerical implementation, which should be compared with the other notebooks on the [static variant](../Notebooks_FMM/BoatRouting.ipynb) of the problem, and on the [generic variant](../Notebooks_FMM/BoatRouting.ipynb) involving a tabulated cost function.\n",
    "- *Time dependency.* The problem considered here is time dependent. However, if time dependency is not a prerequisite for the application, then a much simpler and faster alternative numerical method can be considered, described in the [static problem notebook](../Notebooks_FMM/BoatRouting.ipynb).\n",
    "- *Quadratic cost.* The boat velocity model can be complexified. In fact, the method described below can handle any convex cost, approximated in a suitable manner. However, determining this cost (which depends on the physical properties of the boat), and approximating it (fitting a convex set with an intersection of ellipsoids), may raise difficulties in itself. An fully generic approach, but more costly, is presented in the [generic cost notebook](BoatRoutingGeneric_Time.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and space complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical approach presented below (time dependent problem) is orders of magnitude slover than the fast marching method discussed in [the static problem notebook](../Notebooks_FMM/BoatRouting.ipynb), and uses orders of magnitude more memory. However, the time dependent method should not be immediately dismissed on this account, since there are unexploited optimization opportunities.\n",
    "- *Time complexity.* The time dependent method is embarassingly parallel, may easily take advantage of GPU computing power, possibly more efficiently than what is done here. \n",
    "- *Space complexity.* Bactracking the minimal paths requires to visit the PDE solution in reverse time. Currently, we keep a complete history of the computations, which has a substantial memory cost. A more reasonable implementation may use keypoints in time, as illustrated in possibly in a recursive manner, and recompute some parts of the solution on the fly as needed."
